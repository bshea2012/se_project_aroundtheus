# Project 3: Around The U.S.

**Intro**

This project is made so all the elements are displayed correctly on popular screen sizes. Advanced html and CSS was utilized for this project, expanding on flexbox and introducing grids for more responsive webpages. Widths and different sizing, such as em, rem and others, for elements are used importantly when dealing with responsive design all under the @media query. Along with responsive design concepts being introduced, Figma was as well. Figma is a great tool for collaboration on webpages between designers and developers.
